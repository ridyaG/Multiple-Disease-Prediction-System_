# Multiple Disease Prediction System

This is a web application built with Streamlit that allows users to predict the presence of various diseases. The application provides prediction models for three different diseases: Diabetes, Parkinson's Disease, and Heart Disease. I will try to add more diseases to make it more enhancing.

## About the Project

- **Diabetes Prediction:** Users can input relevant medical data such as number of pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, and more to predict the likelihood of diabetes.

- **Parkinson's Disease Prediction:** Users can enter biomedical voice measurements, including fundamental frequency, amplitude perturbation, noise-to-harmonics ratio, and more, to predict the presence of Parkinson's Disease.

- **Heart Disease Prediction:** Users can input parameters such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and more to predict the probability of heart disease.
